# learn how to sort a list
# remember: in py,variables are not nesessarily initiallized
# and remenber sets are unordered collections of unique elements
# here is an example of sorting a set
name=['apple','candy','banana','pie']
# name.sort()
# print(name)
# name.sort(reverse=True)
# print(name)
print("Here is the sorted list:\n")
print(sorted(name))
# print("Here is the original list:")
# print(name)
name.reverse()
print("Here is another reversed list:")
print(name)
# to run this code, save it in a file named 'sort.py'
# then in 'terminal' input 'python sort.py' to run the code
# and then you will see the sorted list printed out
# press"up" arrow to see the previous commands
# press"ctrl+c" to exit the terminal
